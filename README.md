# web-weather-js
A Simple Weather App Written in Vanilla HTML, CSS and JS, Which Shows Current Date, Weather and Time For a User Inputted Search Location With The Help Of An Weather API.

*NOTE: Currently the https://efaraz27.github.io/web-weather-js/ is not worrking correctly due github enforcing requests made over HTTPS, and the weather API that i am using currently supports only HTTP requests. If you want to use the application properly you will have to clone the repository and open the index.html file in a browser.*
